# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-24)

**Core value:** A mentor can follow one patient from deteriorating simulated vitals through contextual risk, nurse dispatch, acknowledgement, response, resolution, and an auditable record.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Safety, Simulation, and Backend Contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Safety, Simulation, and Backend Contracts) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 6
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Five coarse phases follow the approved research-backed structure.
- MVP is optimized around the seeded P-1042 journey and exactly three roles.
- REST remains authoritative; WebSockets are additive for synthetic updates and invalidation.
- Safety labeling, provenance, deterministic fallback, human confirmation, and auditability are required boundaries.
- [Phase 01]: Use public read-only current monitoring and a bounded development fixture advance; authenticated mutations remain deferred to Phase 2.
- [Phase 01]: Keep migration execution separate from idempotent demo seeding and enforce SQLite foreign keys on every application connection.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Exact P-1042 deterioration values, thresholds, event wording, and note fields remain to be confirmed during phase planning.
- Alert-fatigue semantics and ICU dispatch constraints may need domain validation during Phases 3 and 4.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred to v2: model evaluation views, MIMIC-IV cohort exploration, historical replay, global dispatch optimization, advanced alert policies, live integrations, enterprise identity, tenancy, and native mobile applications.
